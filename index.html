          <p>I have 3 years 6 months experience of being a potato, I mean dog.</p>
          <p>I was born on <b>October 30, 2015</b> in a not so great place where I was pimped out for profit and had 3 liters by the age of 2. My original name was "Lady" (of the night, I suppose).</p>
          <p>However, 2 years into my life I was rescued by <a href="http://rosscountyhumanesociety.org/" target="_blank">Ross County Humane Society</a> and Jackie Cline promptely adopted me on <b>December 15th, 2017</b> and renamed me Zoey!</p> 
          <p> Here is a picture of me on my "gotcha" day, on the 2 hour car ride home with my new mom. I just stared at her in the passenger seat the entire time. </p>

            <h4>Licking toes:</h4>
            <p>For some reason I really love licking feet. It doesn't even have to be a foot that I know and trust. I love them all equally. If there is an exposed sockless foot nearby, I <i>will</i> lick it. </p>

          <div>
            <h4>Eating:</h4>
            <p>Anything that falls on the floor is fair game. I've gained a few pounds since being adopted. Don't body shame me!</p>
